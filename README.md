# Face Detection and Video Processing Application

The project is a Face Detection and Video Processing Application that allows users to upload a video and an image of a target face. The application then analyzes the video, detecting frames where the target face appears. It marks those frames with a bounding box around the face and generates an output video containing only the frames where the target face is present. The processed video can then be downloaded by the user.

## Steps:
1. Upload video and human face.
